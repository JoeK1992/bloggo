Bloggo is a mobile app designed to be a user-friendly, fun and interactive way for users to store their travel history, blogs and photos. The app was created during the project phase during the Northcoders bootcamp.

## Functionality

Users can:

1. Create their own account and log in.
2. Add trips (eg America 2010).
3. Search for and add destinations (eg New York, San Francisco) to these trips and see them marked on an interactive map on the destination screen.
4. Add images and a blog for each destination.
5. Add places (restaurants, attractions, hotels etc) for each destination and provide a link to a website for each place.
6. View their personal travel stats on the users page. This page includes an interactive map with countries the user has visited highlighted, the number of countries and continents they have visited and the percentage of the globe they have traveled to.
7. View other users' stats and trips.
